#### Introduction

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a **domain-specific** language designed to manage data in a relational database system.

There are many different databases built on SQL, with the more popular ones being MySQL, MongoDB, and MariaDB.

##### Basic Concepts

The basic concepts of all SQL database management systems are **databases**, **tables**, and **entries** (rows).

A database is a **container** that can hold **multiple** tables along with the data dictionary and metadata describing those tables. It serves as an **organizational unit** (OU) for managing and storing data.

A table is a structure within a database that is used to organize data into **rows** and **columns**. Each column has a set **data type** that entries must comply to, while each row represents a **table entry**.

Each entry in a table represents a record. The **uniqueness** of each record is **dependent** on the **primary key**, which will be covered later.
